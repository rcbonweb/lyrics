Journy from robin to ben<br><br>

<p>I don’t know why iam writing this. Purely this is for u ben. There is a lot to write but now nothing will coming to my mind every image is little bit blurred. Everything is stored there is no way to delete or remove those wonderful memories. Now iam writing this in a foreign language , as a boy only for exams i write in Engish. I don’t know if anyone can understand this situation. “oppourtunities are like sunrises if u wait too long u miss them” yes i just spoiled it the chances i got.....now it is a previous chapter it will never ever happen again . Thirichu kittilla athanallo athinte bangii. sometimes u win sometimes u learn. Remember Ye aap ka zindagi he, so u have to complete your own role there is no substitute is here. And remember time is so presious it will dosen’t wait for anyone. Samjha ben?</p>
<p>Yaa i just  recollecting the memory and i just find that from the first to the last there is a simple smile on ben’s face thanks for that. Ohh where is this  going man?</p>
<p>This is like a man get a random chance to speak in the public and he got the topic that he dosent know, simply saying ......</p>
<p>Enthanu cheyunnathu enno enthanu athinte karyam enno onnum ariyilla thonni ,athra thanne </p>
<p>ithu aarelum vayikkum enno kano ennu onnum ariyilla tricky aayittulla aarelum kaanumayirikkum ennu vicharikkunnu like the last video of Aisha chaudhary from the movie sky is pink</p>
<p>and remember this is not a vidaparachil there is a long way to go, defenitely meet in some where else. ok bus ben araam karo go and have a tea </p>
